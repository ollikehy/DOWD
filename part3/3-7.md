### When to use docker and the benefits

Docker can be used pretty much any time. The main benefit of Docker is that when running dockerized projects you only need Docker on the machine so when development of a project happens between more than one person there are no problems during the development that stem from the differences between machines. Even when there's only one person doing the development Docker can be used to "separate" the project from the host machine so that even in case of drastic changes the project is unaffected. Docker may include some overhead in the development, but in the long run it'll most likely make the time back and then some. Docker also provides security with it's containerization.

A real life example I can tell to support Docker comes from about a year ago. I needed to do a pull request to a microservice and before that I had to get the microservice to run on my machine. I spent a couple of hours trying to set up all of the different dependencies needed for it and while trying to get it to work with the help of README I noticed that the project was Dockerized. I didn't know what Docker was back then so after some research I installed docker on my machine and was pleasantly surprised when the project worked instantly without a problem.
